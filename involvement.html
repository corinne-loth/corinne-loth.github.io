				<h3 class="h3">The Badger Herald</h3>
				<p>Corinne has been working at <a href="https://badgerherald.com/" class="other">The Badger Herald</a> since the first semester of her freshman year. Her primary role is that of
					a copyeditor, meaning she checks each piece for appropriate AP style, accuracy and readability. Furthermore, this semester she 
					also took on the role of a co-social chair to ensure that all staff members have the opportunity to build professional connections
					with one another and take advantage of the camaraderie offered. Lastly, Corinne has also acted as a reporter in the past to gain experience writing in the journalistic style. 
					Through this organization, she has developed her skills, knowledge and new friendships.

				<h3 class="h3">Leading Women of Tomorrow</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://win.wisc.edu/organization/leadingwomenoftomorrow" class="other">UW-Madison chapter</a> of the Leading Women of Tomorrow organization consists of about 25 women focused on female empowerment and knowledge.
					Though this is Corinne's first full year in the club, she has already been promoted to the Editorial Intern and works
					to coordinate events with other organizations, local businesses, successful women in the professional world, etc. LWT also emphasizes teamwork
					and uplifting women as much as possible in every avenue because that is often neglected in the workplace. Moving forward in her career, this will continue
					to be a priority.
